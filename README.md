Good Reads is the largest community of book lovers on the internet. As a fellow book lover, this project is my study to discover two things:

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on book data
2. Find the best books to read next

The dataset used for this study comes from Good Reads and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks).

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the books listed on Good Reads, with an aim to discover top-rated books in various genres. The analysis can help fellow book readers make an informed decision on their next read. 

## How it Works

This project uses Python and several libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the data. Visual representations of the data are used to make the understanding clear and intuitive.

## Dependencies and Installation Instructions

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib

To install these libraries, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
